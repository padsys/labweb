<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The convergence of HPC, Big Data, and Deep Learning is becoming the next
game-changing opportunity. Modern HPC systems and Cloud Computing platforms
have been fueled with the advances in multi-/many-core architectures, Remote
Direct Memory Access (RDMA) enabled high-speed networks, persistent memory
(PMEM), and NVMe-SSDs. However, many Big Data systems and libraries (such as
Hadoop, Spark, Flink, Memcached) have not embraced such technologies fully.
Recent studies have shown that default designs of these components can not
efficiently leverage the advanced features on modern clusters with RDMA, PMEM,
and NVMe-SSD. In this tutorial, we will provide an in-depth overview of the
architectures, programming models, features, and performance characteristics of
RDMA networks, PMEM, and NVMe-SSD. We will examine the challenges in
re-/co-designing communication and I/O components of Big Data systems and
libraries with these emerging technologies. We will provide benchmark-level
studies and system-level (like Hadoop/Spark/TensorFlow/Memcached) case studies
to discuss how to efficiently use these new technologies for real applications.</p>

<p><strong>[SC'20] INEC: Fast and Coherent In-Network Erasure Coding</strong></p>
<p>Haiyang Shi and Xiaoyi Lu.</p>
<p>In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC), 2020. (Acceptance Rate: 22.3%)</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Erasure coding (EC) is a promising fault tolerance scheme that has been applied
to many well-known distributed storage systems. The capability of Coherent EC
Calculation and Networking on modern SmartNICs has demonstrated that EC will be
an essential feature of in-network computing. In this paper, we propose a set
of coherent in-network EC primitives, named INEC. Our analyses based on the
proposed <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax>-<mathjax>$\beta$</mathjax> performance model demonstrate that INEC primitives can enable
different kinds of EC schemes to fully leverage the EC offload capability on
modern SmartNICs. We implement INEC on commodity RDMA NICs and integrate it
into five state-of-the-art EC schemes. Our experiments show that INEC
primitives significantly reduce 50th , 95th , and 99th percentile latencies,
and accelerate the end-to-end throughput, write, and degraded read performance
of the key-value store co-designed with INEC by up to 99.57%, 47.30%, and
49.55%, respectively.</p>

<p>In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference for High Performance
Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC), 2020. (Acceptance Rate:
22.3%, *Co-First Authors)</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Byte-addressable persistent memory (PMEM) can be directly manipulated by Remote
Direct Memory Access (RDMA) capable networks. However, existing studies to
combine RDMA and PMEM can not deliver the desired performance due to their
PMEM-oblivious communication protocols. In this paper, we propose novel
PMEM-aware RDMA-based communication protocols for persistent key-value stores,
referred to as Remote Direct Memory Persistence based Key-Value stores (RDMP-
KV). RDMP-KV employs a hybrid ‘server-reply/server-bypass’ approach to
‘durably’ store individual key-value objects on PMEM-equipped servers.
RDMP-KV’s runtime can easily adapt to existing (server-assisted durability) and
emerging (appliance durability) RDMA-capable interconnects, while ensuring
server scalability through a lightweight consistency scheme. Performance
evaluations show that RDMP-KV can improve the server-side performance with
different persistent key-value storage architectures by up to 22x, as compared
with PMEM-oblivious RDMA-‘Server-Reply’ protocols. Our evaluations also show
that RDMP-KV outperforms a distributed PMEM-based filesystem by up to 65% and a
recent RDMA-to-PMEM framework by up to 71%.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>With the emergence of modern multi-core CPU architectures that support data
parallelism via vectorization, several storage systems have been employing
SIMD-based techniques to optimize data-parallel operations on in-memory
structures like hash-tables. In this paper, we perform an in-depth
characterization of the opportunities for incorporating AVX vectorization-based
SIMD-aware designs for hash table lookups on emerging CPU architectures. We
analyze the challenges and design dimensions involved in exploiting
vectorization-based parallel key searching over cache-optimized non-SIMD hash
tables. Based on this, we design a comprehensive micro-benchmark suite,
SimdHT-Bench, that enables evaluating the performance and applicability of CPU
SIMD-aware hash table designs for accelerating different read-intensive
workloads. With SimdHT-Bench, we study five different use-case scenarios with
varied workload patterns, on the latest Intel Skylake and Intel Cascade Lake
multi-core CPU nodes. Further, to validate the applicability of SimdHT-Bench,
we employ these performance studies to design a high-performance SIMD-aware
RDMA-based in-memory key-value store to accelerate the Memcached ‘Multi-Get’
workload. We demonstrate that the SIMD-integrated designs can achieve up to
1.45x–2.04x improvement in server-side Get throughput and up to 34% improvement
in end-to-end Multi-Get latencies over the state-of-the-art CPU-optimized
non-SIMD MemC3 hash table design, on a high-performance compute cluster with
Intel Skylake processors and InfiniBand EDR interconnects.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>With the recent emergence of in-memory computing for Big Data analytics,
memory-centric and distributed key-value storage has become vital to
accelerating data processing workloads, in high-performance computing (HPC) and
data center environments. This has led to several research works focusing on
advanced key-value store designs with Remote- Direct-Memory-Access (RDMA) and
hybrid `DRAM+NVM’ storage designs. However, these existing designs are
constrained by the blocking store/retrieve semantics; incurring additional
complexity with the introduction of high data availability and durability
requirements. To cater to the performance, scalability, durability and
resilience needs of the diverse key-value store-based workloads (e.g., online
transaction processing, offline data analytics, etc.), it is therefore vital to
fully exploit resources on modern HPC systems. Moreover, to maximize server
scalability and end-to-end performance, it is necessary to focus on designing
an RDMA-aware communication engine that goes beyond optimizing the key-value
store middleware for better client-side latencies.</p>
<p>Towards addressing this, in this dissertation, we present a `holistic approach’
to designing high-performance, resilient and heterogeneity-aware key-value
storage for HPC clusters, that encompasses: (1) RDMA-enabled networking, (2)
high-speed NVMs, (3) emerging byte-addressable persistent memory devices, and,
(4) SIMD-enabled multi-core CPU compute capabilities. We first introduce
non-blocking API extensions to the RDMA- Memcached client, that allows an
application to separate the request issue and completion phases. This
facilitates overlapping opportunities by truly leveraging the one-sided
characteristics of the underlying RDMA communication engine, while conforming
to the basic Set/Get semantics. Secondly, we analyze the overhead of employing
memory-efficient resilience via Erasure Coding (EC), in an online fashion.
Based on this, we extend our proposed RDMA-aware key-value store, that supports
non-blocking API semantics, to enable overlapping the EC encoding/decoding
compute phases with the scatter/gather communication protocol involved in
resiliently storing the distributed key-value data objects.</p>
<p>This work also examines durable key-value store designs for emerging persistent
memory technologies. While RDMA-based protocols employed in existing volatile
DRAM-based key-value stores can be directly leveraged, we find that there is a
need for a more integrated approach to fully exploit the fine-grained
durability of these new byte-addressable storage devices. We propose 'RDMP-KV’,
that employs a hybrid 'server-reply/server- bypass’ approach to 'durably’ store
individual key-value pair objects on the remote persistent memory-equipped
servers via RDMA. RDMP-KV’s runtime can easily adapt to existing
(server-assisted durability) and emerging (appliance durability) RDMA-capable
interconnects, while ensuring server scalability and remote data consistency.
Finally, the thesis explores SIMD-accelerated CPU-centric hash table designs,
that can enable higher server throughput. We propose an end-to-end SIMD-aware
key-value store design, 'SCOR- KV’, which introduces optimistic
'RDMA+SIMD’-aware client-centric request/response offloading protocols. SCOR-KV
can minimize the server-side data processing overheads to achieve better
scalability, without compromising on the client-side latencies.</p>
<p>With this as the basis, we demonstrate the potential performance gains of the
proposed designs with online (e.g, YCSB) and offline (e.g, in-memory and
distributed burst-buffer over Lustre for Hadoop I/O) workloads on small-scale
and production-scale HPC clusters.</p>
